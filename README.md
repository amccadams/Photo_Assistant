<h1>Photo Assistant</h1>



<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This is my example project for the Unit 2 (Ruby) Capstone for Nashville Software School Development Fundamentals course.</p>

<p>The contstraints of the project are that they must use standard library Ruby with the exception of being able to use ActiveRecord as an ORM. Future exceptions may be added, but the concept with this capstone is to demonstrate mastery of Ruby itself.<p>
